## Overview
This assignment involves the function declaration in a class named `Point3D` in the `/Ex1/headers/Point3D.h` file. The class is designed to represent a point in three-dimensional space.
 
## Implementation Steps
 
 **Class File:**
   - Class Definition location: `/Ex1/headers/Point3D.h`
   - Implementation location: `/Ex1/src/Point3D.cpp`
 
 **Constructor:**
   - Write a constructor for `Point3D` that takes three double variables as arguments.
   - Initializes member variables with the provided argument values.
 
 **Getters:**
   - Add member functions (getters) to the class to display the member variables of the class.
   - Example: `x(),y(),z()` displays the x,y,z values of the `Point3D` object.
 
 **Test Program File:**
   - Test Program: `/Ex1/src/Writer.cpp`
