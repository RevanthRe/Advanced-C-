# Assignment4: Files handling in C++ 

## Overview
This assignment involves file handling in C++ to read and process triangle data from a file. The implementation is split between two files: `Reader.cpp` and `Writer.cpp`. The tasks include using the `getline()` function, utilizing `istringstream` for string parsing, creating `Point3D` objects, and populating a vector of `Triangle` objects and to read only `vertex` value from .stl file.

## Implementation
**Implemented getline() function in getTriangles() in location **D:\Adv\courseCode\Sketcher `Exercise\Ex4\Ex4\src\Reader.cpp`.**
**Implemented `if condition` logic to read only vertex value from .stl file in location `Ex4\src\Reader.cpp`.**
**Used an istringstream to parse the string in location `Ex4\Updated Sketchers\src\Reader.cpp`**.
**Taken all values and pass each (x, y, z) values to the point3D class object in location `Ex4\src\Reader.cpp`**.
**Added that object in the Triangle class type vector in location `Ex4\Updated Sketchers\src\Reader.cpp`**.
